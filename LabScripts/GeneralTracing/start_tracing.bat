@echo off

rem Stop any previous tracing sessions that may have accidentally been left
rem running. Otherwise the start command will fail with incredibly cryptic
rem errors. Ignore all warnings because in most cases they are expected.

rem You have to invoke -capturestate because otherwise the ETW gnomes will not
rem reliably record the user-mode data to your trace. Do not anger the gnomes.
