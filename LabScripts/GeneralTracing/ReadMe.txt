The set of files in this directory serve as an example of how to measure CPU
and GPU usage with ETW in a lab scenario, such as for regression testing. Both
start_tracing.bat and stop_tracing.bat must be run from an administrator command
prompt. It is assumed that WPT is in the path, either from being installed or
from being copied to the test machine.

Sample usage:
Run an administrator command prompt. Then, make an output directory:
> mkdir %temp%\output
Start tracing, optionally with the detailed flag:
> start_tracing.bat detailed
Do the action that you want profiled, then stop tracing, telling the script to
put the results in %temp%\output:
> stop_tracing.bat %temp%\output
Data will be found in .csv files in %temp%\output, and will be summarized in
results.json.

start_tracing.bat starts tracing with the minimal flags needed to record
process information, CPU usage, context switches, and GPU usage.

stop_tracing.bat stops tracing, merges the kernel and user traces. It then uses
CreateExporterConfig.py to create a .json file which uses the marks inserted
into the trace by "xperf -m" to tightly bound the relevant section of the trace.
This information plus the set of summary .wpaProfile files is put into the
.json file. You can optionally pass an output directory to stop_tracing.bat and
the .etl, .csv, and .json files will be put there.

Then wpaexporter is invoked with the .json file to create a set of .csv files
that summarize the data in the trace. The .csv files are then summarized using
SummarizeData.py, producing another .json file.

These batch files should work on Windows 7 but have actually only been tested on
Windows 10. If somebody tests on other operating systems then they should update
this comment for easy PR points.

Adding additional types of analysis is 'easily' done by making sure that the
appropriate data is being recorded (being sure not to increase the data rate too
much as we wouldn't want to affect the results we are measuring) and then adding
.wpaProfile files to define the data to be exported.

Details on how the export works have previously been written up at:
